A virtualized journaling application where users can add their regular diary entries. This application can substitute the need for maintaining a physical bedside diary for people who have a habit of journaling their days on a regular basis. The inner journal paging application is designed to have a darker theme to imitate the usual nighttime conditions of a person who writes their diary entries at the end of the day.
